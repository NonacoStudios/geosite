### GEOCATS:V420 - Super Complimentary Edition

- Coperation is key. As Vulcan sets up their infrastructure, we're happily building our game in anticipation of their new blockchain.
- In the interest of entertainment while we patiently wait, we are releasing Geocats Complimentary edition for everyone to try out. A demo that is open for anyone to play! This version will not have any interaction with blockchain and exists to showcase what we've been working on.

#### **Here's a quick look at our GeoQuarium and the new overworld map that we're creating.**

We consulted with an expert catstronaut currently working on  the Geoquariums. This video was filmed to showcase a bit of what our cosmos contains. Here's what Catstronaut #9 had to share a look at our interstellar backyard!

## **Research & Development**

### Chrysoberyl and it's effects on 0xoplasmosis, preliminary tests are promising!

Cat's Eye crystals are a type of Aluminum Oxide which exibit a rare optical trait known as *chatoyancy*. Chatoyancy is a certain effect seen in gemstones which is caused by light reflecting perpendicular to the mineral's fibres. The result is a rare crystal that looks similar to the unique eye of a feline. 
When light is concentrated through this crystal, it takes on a special property that is seen to disable 0xoplasmosis infection in lab enviroment tests. Whether this leads to any useful developments in curing the afflicted cats remains to be seen. 
As of this year, NONACO has significantly cut funding to it's science department stating "What we don't know can't hurt us."

### Meow Against the Machine

I've been intentionally putting bugs and errors into the NONACO codebase. That way, I'll always have a job with this backwards company.
