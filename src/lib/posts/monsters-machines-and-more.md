## **The first Geocats are out!**

<center>

Congratulations to the lucky individuals that have their very own Geocat!

Each of these NFT’s will be an integral mechanic of Geocats, offering different in-game experiences depending on which Geocat you are using.

*If you feel like you missed out, stay tuned because there will be other chances to get your own Geocat*

## **Timeframe.**

We have had quite a few questions about when Geocats will be released.
</center>

To answer simply, we can only give a rough estimate of next year sometime. There are plenty of caveats to this statement that require some context…

Geocats is currently a hyper-micro team, and although we have tons of help and expertise from Vulcan, it will still take time to create this game. It’s important to us not to release a half finished or rushed game.
In 2021 we intend to expand our team to meet demand.
