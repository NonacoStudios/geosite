## **Important "News"**

### Introduction

Thanks for opening up the very first edition of GEONEWS. It's with this publication that we intend to distill our most important information into one place. Like every NONACO endeavour, we'll see how this idea evolves and grows over the following months. 

### GEOCATS:V2

This month saw the launch of Geocats Version 2. The launch went smoothly, and our amazing beta testers gave us a lot of cool feedback. Players can expect a patch to V2 in the coming weeks. Enormous gratitude to everyone who's shared feedback with us. We appreciate you!

### GEOCATS:V3

This is a massive update for us. We will be launching a few core features that are long overdue...Mainly, the option to play as whatever cats you have in your wallet! This iteration of Geocats will also include the mysterious GEOQUARIUMS for players. More information about these customisable space-pods will be featured in a spotlight article in the next issue of GEONEWS. 
Finally, we have been building the in-game GEODEX. A compendium of our creations, and a database of all NFTs we have created so far. We feel that this featured will be appreciated by those of us who like organised structures.

Version 3 also has a more focussed and clear storyline. We're including more hints and new cutscenes.

## **Arts & "Culture"**

### Does paint taste as good as it looks?

No, but pixels do!
	My name is Japhy, and I am an artist working on the look of some of Geocats’ many levels, characters, objects, and interfaces.  Over a year ago, I was working primarily in the hand-drawn, hand-painted, and hand-sculpted realm. But as a multi-faceted artist, different mediums have always excited me.
	At the start of the pandemic, I increased my exploration into graphic design, and now, pixel art! Kurtis, who was already about a year into his own conception of Geocats, asked me if I wanted to do art for the game. I was a bit daunted. I had never wielded a pixel-brush before, but I had played my share of old NES games, and I had always wanted to do video game art. Roughly a week or so later, I was working on my first project: a variety of backgrounds (including fractal pyramids, a neon cat rave, and a Viking fiord).
	I like to think that my background in physical art adds a slightly different spin to the world of pixel art, while still taking notes from the well-known stuff. Ultimately, Kurtis and I always talk about the joy of “simplification” in pixel art. How the limitation of a square can force an artist to portray what matters most in an object (such as its basic shape and iconic colour palette).


As for what I’m working on now, I have taken a slight detour away from the earthy nature of designing spaces like Canopy Creek and the mushroom cave, to outer space, and the more mechanized creations that our universe of blocky cats have maintained. I recently completed a new view of the GeoRing, where players will be able to see part of its outer shell in the light of a planet. The art for this was greatly inspired by the works of H.R. Giger, Heavy Metal Magazine, and Star Wars for NES.

So to answer the question again: Yes, a pixel has a unique taste… one that will surely take me to many uncharted places.

### Qix-Mono, Our Dyslexic Friendly Typeface 

A lot of work has gone into our libre typeface. Here's a bit more information about it. 
We are happy to accomodate people however we're able. If anyone here feels like an accessibility option they require is missing from our game, please let us know and we'll see what we can do.

## **Research & "Development"**

​		Here's the stuff that Wolfi will talk about

### Vulcon 1 & Vulcan UK Meetup

Over the last months, NONACO has sent representatives to both the Vulcon 1 in Amsterdam, and UK Meetup in England. This was a great opportunity to finally meet new people, and share a bit about what we've been working on. 
Also, everyone who attended Vulcon 1 was issued their very own Pumpkin Cat. Congrats to them.
We hope to see many of you in Greece this summer for Vulcon 2.

## **Editorials & "Opinions"**

### Letter from the Editor

This project really grows in new ways, and it's entirely due to the talented people in this space. Thanks to everyone here!
— *Kurt*

### Letters to the Editor

**On the Existence of NO.Cat**
I have heard rumours of a glitched-out cat, living inside those evil entertainment machines at Geistesfluch Arcade. Whether or not these claims are substantiated by fact, I propose we remove this horrible business from our fair city. 
— *Concerned Citizen*

**NONACO Simulated Niblits: RECALL**
To all of the cats making a big stink about finding metal shards in their Niblets. Stop complaining! Nonaco and its subsidiaries do not deserve the constant criticism... Haven't *you* made mistakes in your life? Forgive and forget... That's the way it should be!
*(This letter was submitted as part of a promotion sponsored by NONACO, and the opinions are my own.)*
— *xX_LogicalThinker_Xx*

**To the Funny Feline Leaving Donut Shack Yesterday, With Their Arms Full of Snacks**
You dropped a bag of catnip on your way out. Hit me up if you want it back. You might want to hurry though – There's really not much left...
